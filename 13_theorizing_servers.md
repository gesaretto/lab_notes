#Week 13: Theorizing Servers

##Opening Remarks

> Existence of __system administrators__; creation of servers conceived as _software platforms_. Servers used to be boxes of hardware; right now they are almost abstract, existing as a piece of code. Following the principle of the Turing machine, these servers can _emulate_ hardware.

> Each one of us is going to get a small _cloud server_.

## Servers

- __What is a server?__ Random people answer the question:
    
	- A large storage space (like a brain?);
    
	- A specialized computer that hosts websites;
    
	- It _throws_ (_serves_ etymologically) information in real time;
    
	- It is a _service_.

- __What is a server?__ __D. T.__ answers the question:
	
	- A computer that is __always on__ and is __always listening__; a beefy machine that _serves_ pages;
    
	- _Spotify_ as a _server_ that simply _serves_ music to a collectivity of users or devices;
    
	- Think of the old _computer_ accessed through a _terminal_: we had a dumb machine at our disposal, and we had to plug it into a more powerful object in order to work on elaborate information; we then moved to the _personal computer_; then we moved back to the centralized idea of powerful _servers_ and impotent computers with the spread of _Internet_ and, right now, the __cloud__;
    
	- Servers rule the world; everything is on a server: movies, music, information, the economy, my papers;
    
	- The basic definition (__always on, always answering__) remains valid.
    
## The Cloud

- A five minute crash course on the __cloud__.

    - Cloud is today known as __platform as a service__ (?); the _cloud_ virtualizes the various components that constitute a server.
        
		- At its core, there is a piece of hardware; this piece of hardware has an operating system running.
        
		- The difference between __cloud__ and __traditional server__ has to be stressed; for instance, the fact that the cloud does not depend on a specific machine, implies that its hardware capabilities are _elastic_: a heavier traffic will automatically be redirected to a more powerful machine.
        
		- This server will have __ports__, like our own machine;
        
		- This server will have __storage space__, like our own machine;
            
			- These components, which we associate to a computer's actual hardware, are pieces of software on the cloud; they are elastic and work dynamically.
        
		- This server will have a _database_, a _security system_, a _payment system_.
    
	- Amazon asks us not to worry about the __hardware__ requisites of this entire system; it is a service, they will take care of replacing the old machines and of keeping them always on and always listening.
    
	- The experience of accessing the __cloud__ is virtually identical to the experience of accessing an old, traditional server.
