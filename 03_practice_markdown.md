#Week 3: Fiddling with Markdown

##Recap from last week

Think of data and data flows as vectors; then, think about the entirety of literary production and **life itself** as the production of vectors - as vectors themselves.

- Blogging (__Vector 1__)
    
    ------------------->
    
    [Word Press - XML - XML Editor]


- Academic writing (__Vector 2__)
    
    ---------->
    
    [MS Word - Doc - .pdf]

- Mail (__Vector 3__)
    
    --------------------->
	
	[MS Outlook - ...]

Now, our goal is to concentrate the entirety of this production and place it within a single box; we will have a single format (which will be, if you want, _plaintext_), a single editor (we still have to choice) and complementary systems for publishing, backup and so on.

What about a single editor, then? It would amplify our possibilities of interaction/intervention on every aspect of our textual production.

Plaintext: why not __markdown__, then? It is a plaintext format, it is easy to use and it is truly versatile. _Let us get started!_

##Practicing Markdown

> Markdown as a FORMAT, independently from the editor.

- How to emphasize a text? With asterisks.

	*emphasis*

- Or with two asterisks.

	**emphasis!**

How to write headings? With hashtags.

```
#Most important title#
##Important title#
###Least important title###
```

- The extension for Markdown is **.md**. From now on, these notes will be written in *markdown*.

- Here, when I __TAB__ something I indicate that the text that I am writing has some sort of CODE quality. It is an environment where, all of a sudden, space and formatting visually matter.

                   Here is a text under tab.

- More Interesting features. Imagine I have to insert a note[^1].

[^1]: "This is interesting stuff."


- Or `code`.

- ``` code block that is related to code that I do not want to be different from what I am actually writing and how I am formatting it. ```

- Let's put a __link__ here. [Deboscio](www.ildeboscio.it).
- ` Hey this is a tick and this is important code that has to be preserved forever. `
- ` :D `
- Or: 
``` 
Welcome to the JUNGLE! SPACE IS STILL RELEVANT HERE!                          YOWZ.    Yawz. 
```

`### A new section. About what you should be doing.`

- Please take some time to consider options for visualization and editing. Very fascinating stuff happening inside of this section that will start *NOW*.

` TICK `

```

Tick?
