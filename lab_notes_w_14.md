    - Let us picture the incredibly sophisticated facility that might be the Amazon server: a huge network of machines that create a redundant system of storage and processing; let us literally picture it as a gigantic room full of machines.
- The server is a box - like the case of a personal computer - which is itself connected to other boxes: it is the allocation of a portion of this huge networkof of machines and interactions;
- Try typing ``ping google.com`` into my terminal; it will produce an explicity, non human-readable address to access the website; then it will start trying to understand how long it takes my machine to access the server and come back. This is called __latency time__.
- Try typing ``traceroute google.com`` now: it will trace the steps that allow my machine to access the server that hosts a website.

This way of access - a sort of secure tunnel - is encrypted and protected; nobody will be able to know what is in it or to tamper with it. It is a method that allows users to access website that could be otherwise inaccessible.
- Let us use this format to access the server through this secure
